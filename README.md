## Description

The goal of this project is to create an application that takes user input from the command line to create a profile page for a team of software engineers. Using JavaScript, node, Inquirer, and object oriented programming, the application generates an HTML file that includes information on different team members, whose roles have been assigned to classes and subclasses of objects within the JavaScript file. This allows similar roles to share similar attributes within the code and helps dynamically create the divs within the HTML based on user input.

## Installation

Make sure you have node and Inquirer version 8.2.4 installed on your system.

## Usage

Open the application by navigating to the directory from your command line. Then make sure the dependencies are installed by executing "npm i". Next, you can run "node index.js" to start the application. You'll be presented with a series of input prompts for a team manager, then given the options to enter more input for either an intern or engineer. You can then exit the application from that same menu and the HTML file will be written to the "dist" folder of the directory.
